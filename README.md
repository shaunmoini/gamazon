# Gamazon

A simple e-commerce themed web application developed using Node.js and MongoDB.

## Set Up

After cloning the directory, run `npm install` in the project directory to install all dependecies. 

The application assumes there is a local instance of MongoDB running. If not, refer to [this](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) in order to set one up. This must be done before running the application. 

Once the dependencies are installed and a local instance of MongoDB is running, run `node app.js` to start the web server.
